* make sure to do the following:
- install mysql for rails, you can do so by running this command 'sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev'
- update the db credentials in config/database.yml

* things I wanted to do (unfortunately due to my limited time I wasn't able to do all of that):
- use sonarqube to analyze the code and develop a high quality code
- create unit tests
- get an instant notification when any error occurs in the system through Slack
- make the structue of the json response the same for all requests (success and error requests) like the below:
{
	"is_success": true|false,
	"status_code": 200|201|422|500..etc,
	"message": "success|error",
	"data|errors": [{}, {}, ...{}] or {}
}
